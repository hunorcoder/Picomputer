There are all the 3D models for Picomputer. If you can, use the [3MF file](../3mf) to print, because it contains all setiings and models, and it it so much easier to use.
## 3D Printing settings
I printed the components with these settings on my Bambu Lab A1, but they should work for any printer.

- 0.2mm layers
- 25% infill
- Infill pattern: gyroid
- 2 wall loops
- 4 bottom/top shell layers
- Support: tree/organic, slim
- No brim
